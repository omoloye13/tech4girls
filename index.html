                        platform to intervene in
                        the socialization and realization of a society where women
                        are visible and are treated equally as men.Technology is a billion dollar
                        industry that is widely used to solve various problem but it is unfortunate
                        that we find it difficult to see women there as it is dominated by men. The major challenges
                        women
                        face in the tech space is that they believe they don't have the right education
                        to fit into the field, irrespective of the course you studied or what you want to
                        study technology is used to solve different type of problems be it education, health,
                        research or even product management. With technology, you could make yourself self employed
                        or you could employ people and help the world a particular problem we need more women to
                        join the tech world because there are lots of challenges which i believe it is
                        only women that can solve

                    <p>T4GI is women fueling Technology,
                        a digital advocacy campaign and media project for girls and
                        women to explore the roles of technology in advancing gender equality it also highlights the
                        gender
                        gap in technology and advocates for women and girls access to and control of technology.
                        At T4GI we are set to train women and girls in digital skills, soft skills to bridge the gap of
                        low self confidence amongst women in our society
                        and also to prepare the girl child empowered as they gradually move into womanhood, at the end
                        of the training we will be organising an hackathon where the technological skills
                        they have gotten will be used to solve real life solutions.We do not focus on empowering the
                        girl child or women alone, we also advocate for feminist ideology, protection of the young
                        females and women, adolescent sexuality,
                        gender & human right issues and equal opportunities for all.</p>
